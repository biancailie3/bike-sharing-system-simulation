Bike Sharing Simulation
A Python simulation of a bike-sharing system using SimPy.
Features:
Multiple stations with different capacities and initial bike counts
Time-slot specific bike failure probabilities
Customer trips simulated in parallel
Bike rebalancing between stations
Tracking of unhappy customers (no bikes or full stations)
Visualization of bike levels, maintenance, and customer satisfaction
This project demonstrates how bike-sharing systems behave under varying demand and operational strategies.
